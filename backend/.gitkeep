# This directory should contain:
# - phish_model.pkl (your trained ML model)
# - vectorizer.pkl (your TF-IDF vectorizer)
# - main.py (FastAPI application)
# - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)

# Note: .pkl files are typically large and should not be committed to git.
# Add them to .gitignore and provide instructions for users to place their own trained models here.
